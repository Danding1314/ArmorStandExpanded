# ArmorStandExpanded

### **Adds a fully functional ArmorStand to your Pocketmine-MP Server**

[![](https://poggit.pmmp.io/shield.state/ArmorStandExpanded)](https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/ArmorStandExpanded)

#### First of all: Why did I call it ArmorStandExpanded? 
At the moment you get a fully functional ArmorStand just like you would expect an fully functional ArmorStand. 
The Reason for the "Expanded" is that this Plug-in is not yet at the end of its Development. 
I plan to add some additional Functions and Gadgets.

Let yourself be surprised.

#### What can I do with the ArmorStand?

As you would surely expect, you can equip it with your Armor for Storage or to show off.
All you need to do is take your Item in hand and right-click on the ArmorStand. The armor Parts are immediately put in their correct Place.

##### OffHand
The OffHand can also be equipped with the following Items:
* Arrows
* Maps
* Fireworks
* Shields
* Totem of Undying

These Things are also put in the OffHand automatically

##### MainHand
All Items that do not have an allocated Space, as mentioned above, are placed in the MainHand

##### How do I get my stuff back?
Just like you got it on. Right Click on the Part you want to have and that's it. 

The OffHand item can only be taken when the MainHand is empty. (Its a secret TODO, pshh...)

##### How can I break the armor stand?

Its an Entity. Treat it like an Entity.

Hit the ArmorStand until it breaks. Thatâ€™s it. All items are dropped along with the ArmorStand

##### How can i set the Pose?

Thats easy. Just give it a RightClick while you are sneaking. 

The armor stand has 12 poses that are switched through with each right click

#### What did you mean about the PlotProtection?

Since the ArmorStand is usually not implemented in Pocketmine-MP, it is not checked by the MyPlot PlotProtection.

ArmorStandExpanded does this for you.

#### ToDo
- [ ] Add Events for equip, remove, change Pose, place and break
- [ ] Add some additional Functions and Gadgets
- [ ] ... (Make suggestions :wink:)
